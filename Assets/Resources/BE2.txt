I stare out of the hospital window,
watching the relentless acid rain pouring down,
feeling the weight of my choices.
I was first promoted,
but it seems like my boss just cannot be satisfied.
He eventually firedme because I refused
to continue covering up for the company's excessive waste emissions
from the government.
They replaced me...
They replaced me with someone "Smart"....
My youngest, struggling to breathe in a sterile hospital room,
and this is where I realized the importance
of protecting our beautiful planet.
I thought I was securing their future,
but in reality, I compromised the world they have to live in.
The echoes of my decisions reverberate through the toxic air,
and I wonder if the price was too high.
